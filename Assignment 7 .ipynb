    "   - Hyperparameters are settings that control the behavior and performance of the model but are not learned from the data during training.\n",
    "   - Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to search for the best combination of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "   - Perform cross-validation to further evaluate the model's performance and assess its generalization ability.\n",
    "   - This involves dividing the data into multiple subsets or folds and training/evaluating the model on different combinations of these folds.\n",
    "   - Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and helps identify potential issues like overfitting or data sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Model Deployment and Testing:\n",
    "   - Once the model is trained, validated, and optimized, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "   - Test the model's performance on a separate test dataset or in real-world scenarios to validate its effectiveness.\n",
    "   - Monitor and evaluate the model's performance over time and iterate on the model development process if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
